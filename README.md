# Introduction to AI

This repository contains the Python codes for the introduction to AI course by The Climber's My Captain Program
for which I am a mentor.

 The contents are arranged according to batches (or months). 

 However, they more or less follow a similar format.

 ## PROGRESSION

 1. The first 2 jupyter-notebooks are basics of Python, wherein I talk about basics of Python, variables, control statements, functions, strings, basic data structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets etc, iterables, along with some pythonic way of writing code including list comprehension, functions like map etc.

 2. The next 2 jupyter-notebooks have examples from basics about libraries numpy, pandas and pyplot. Concepts like nd-array, DataFrame, Series, plotting etc. are detailed along with their usage. Some key snippets include time difference in execution between numpy and equivalent python methods, analytics using dataframes etc.

 3. The 5th jupyter-notebook has examples about classification using the breast-cancer dataset from sklearn. The concepts of train-test split, training, prediction, precision and recall etc. are explained by using sklearn's built-in functions. Naiye Bayes, Tree Based Algorithms including DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoost, Bagging Classifier etc, Support Vector Machines, KNN Classifier etc. are applied on the data using sklearn's libraries and results are compared. It also has introduction to parameter and hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection.

 4. The last jupyter-notebook has examples about clustering and regression. Boston Housing Prices dataset is used from sklearn for regression. Examples of co-relation amongst different features and the results are shown via plots using pyplot. Linear Regression in concepts on a 2-d plane is explained via different examples. Some examples of ploynomial regression are also given along with concepts like R2 score etc. For clustering, iris dataset is used (*without labels*). Various algorithms are applied on the dataset and the resulting clusters are visually compared to the original groups.
